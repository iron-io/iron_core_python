# iron_core_python

iron_core_python is a collection of common functions for working with the RESTful APIs 
that we build at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) from Python.

## It Is

* Service-agnostic
* Pip- and easy_install-installable
* Well documented
* google app engine compatible

## It Is Not

* An API wrapper. Those are specific to each service, and you can generally find them 
by checking the documentation for the service.
* A place for service-specific code. This is only meant to handle the basic, common 
interaction.

## Installation

You can use [pip](http://pip-installer.org) or [easy_install](http://wiki.python.org/moin/EasyInstall) 
to install the [release version](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iron_core_python). If you'd 
like to work with a development or beta version, retrieve the files [from Github](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_core_python)
